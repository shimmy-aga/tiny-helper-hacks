### Tiny little mockup generator 
- This script servers as a mockup gen tool, it can create mockups with the logo/design you select (.png, .eps, .webp, .jpg, .psd, .tif supported).
- It uses premade PSD's located in the `base` folder. For every design you select a mockup is created.
- In the `designs` folder you can place your designs/logos for easy access


### QUICK START
1. Open any of the included PSD file's in `base` folder
2. In the PSD file from toolbar open `files` > `scripts` > `browse` and then select the `main.js` script.
3. Select the design or designs you want to mockup, selecting several designs will output a batch of mockups.
4. Select the folder you want the mockups to be saved in. A premade `output` folder already exists.

### TINY MOCKUP TOOL
This project contains two mockup generators: 
- `single` is specifically for replacing the design in a single PSD item/document, iterating through designs.
- `batch` is designed to automatically generate several mockups for several items and several designs, iterating through designs per item

Both folders contain their own readme file, with instructions on how to use. 

### DEPENDENCIES
- Adobe Photoshop Version: 26.11.0 20250918

### IMPORTANT
- Dont rename folders or change root structure, unless you're willing to make integral changes to the `main.jsx` and `config.json` files.
