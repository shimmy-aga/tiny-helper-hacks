### TINY MOCKUP TOOL
This project contains two mockup generators: 
- `single` is specifically for replacing the design in a single PSD item/document, iterating through designs.
- `batch` is designed to automatically generate several mockups for several items and several designs, iterating through designs per item

Both folders contain their own readme file, with instructions on how to use. 

### DEPENDENCIES
- Adobe Photoshop Version: 26.11.0 20250918

### IMPORTANT
- Dont rename folders or change root structure, unless you're willing to make integral changes to the `main.jsx` and `config.json` files.
